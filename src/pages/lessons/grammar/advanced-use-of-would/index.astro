        <p class="lesson-intro">
          <strong>Would</strong> is not just the “conditional word.” At C1 level, it
          expresses <em>habituality, tentativeness, hypotheticality, politeness,
          volition, narrative projection, and reported stance</em>. This lesson takes a
          descriptive approach similar to Leech’s reference grammar, but stays practical
          for exam performance.

              Accurate use of <strong>would</strong> is strong evidence of
              high-level control of modality and discourse. Examiners love this.

      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>1. 🔁 <span class="key-word">Would</span> for past habit (repeated actions)</h2>
        <p>
          Here, <strong>would</strong> marks <em>repeated, characteristic actions</em> in
          the past. It does <strong>not</strong> normally describe states.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-neutral">
          <strong>Leech-style note 🧠</strong><br />
          <strong>Would</strong> for past habit assumes a
          <em>temporal frame is already active</em>. You usually cannot open a story with
          <em>“I would visit my grandmother every weekend”</em> without first establishing
          <em>when</em>.

      <!-- 2. TENTATIVE / SOFTENED ASSERTION -->
      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>2. 🎭 Tentative or softened assertion</h2>
        <p>
          In advanced discourse, <strong>would</strong> marks your stance as
          <em>cautious</em> or <em>polite</em>, not simply conditional.
        </p>

        <div class="example-strip">
          <div>
            <p class="emph">I would argue that this policy is ineffective.</p>
            <p class="note">Cautious, distance-creating. Good for IELTS Writing Task 2.</p>

            <p class="note">Polite understatement rather than direct criticism.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-accent">
          <strong>Exam tip 🎓</strong><br />
          Tentative <strong>would</strong> is especially valuable in
          <em>IELTS Speaking Part 3</em> and <em>CELPIP Speaking tasks</em>, where examiners
          listen for nuanced stance rather than absolute statements.
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. HYPOTHETICALITY -->
      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>3. 🌫 Hypothetical / remote situations</h2>
        <p>
          Here, <strong>would</strong> expresses <em>remoteness from reality</em>: unreal,
          unlikely, or purely imagined situations.
        </p>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><span class="emph">I would attend the meeting if I had more time.</span></li>
          <li><span class="emph">Most people would choose convenience over quality.</span></li>
          <li><span class="emph">Without public transport, many residents would struggle.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
          This is not “future tense.” It is a modal marking <strong>distance</strong> from
          reality (semantic remoteness).
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 4. POLITENESS -->
      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>4. 🤝 Politeness and social distancing</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Would</strong> softens requests, offers, and refusals. This is
          high-level pragmatic control.
        </p>

        <div class="example-grid">
          <div class="example-block">
            <p class="emph">Would you mind clarifying that point?</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. VOLITION -->
      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>5. 💪 Volition and “refusal” in the past</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Would</strong> can show <em>willingness</em> or <em>stubborn behaviour</em>
          in the past. With inanimate subjects, it often signals metaphorical “refusal.”
        </p>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><span class="emph">He would always help anyone who asked.</span></li>
          <li><span class="emph">She wouldn’t listen to anyone’s advice.</span></li>
          <li><span class="emph">The car wouldn’t start again.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
          In the last example, the car has no will, but English uses
          <em>wouldn’t</em> to personify mechanical failure.
        </p>

      <!-- 6. NARRATIVE DISPLACEMENT -->
      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>6. 📚 Narrative displacement (“future in the past”)</h2>
        <p>
          This use presents an event as <em>future from a past viewpoint</em>. It is common
          in narrative and reflective writing.
        </p>

        <div class="example-strip timeline">
          <div>
            <p class="emph">I didn’t know that this decision would change my life.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="note">
          This is useful in IELTS Task 2 when you describe past decisions and their later
          impact, and in CELPIP when telling stories or experiences.

      <section class="lesson-section">
        <h2>7. 🗣 Reported speech</h2>
        <p>
          In reported speech, <strong>would</strong> often corresponds to
          <strong>will</strong> in the original statement.
