## Goal
Write opinions that sound **academic and accurate** by avoiding absolute claims.

## What hedging is
Hedging means making a claim **measured**, not extreme. Instead of “always” and “never,” you use language like:

- **often / generally / typically**
- **tend to**
- **may / might / can / could**
- **in many cases**
- **it is likely that**
- **appears to / seems to**

Why it matters: in IELTS Task 2 and CELPIP opinion responses, absolute statements are easy to attack. Hedging protects your argument and improves tone.

---

## The two big rules
1) Hedge **big claims**, not small facts.  
2) Hedge **once or twice** per paragraph. Over-hedging makes your argument weak.

---

## Core patterns (high-frequency, high score)

### 1) Adverbs of frequency
Use these when you’re making generalizations.

**Strong:** Social media increases anxiety.  
**Better:** Social media **often** increases anxiety, especially among teens.

Useful words: **often, generally, typically, in many cases**

### 2) “tend to” + verb
This is one of the best IELTS/CELPIP upgrades.

**Strong:** Remote work improves productivity.  
**Better:** Remote work **tends to** improve productivity for focused tasks.

### 3) Modals (possibility)
Use these to avoid overclaiming.

**Strong:** Technology causes isolation.  
**Better:** Technology **can** contribute to isolation when it replaces face-to-face interaction.

Use: **may, might, can, could**

### 4) “It is likely that…”
Use this for trends and predictions.

**Strong:** Housing prices will drop soon.  
**Better:** **It is likely that** housing prices will stabilize rather than drop sharply.

---

## Common mistakes
### Over-hedging (too weak)
**Bad:** This might maybe perhaps reduce the problem.  
**Better:** This **may** reduce the problem, **especially if** it targets root causes.

### No conditions (too vague)
**Weak:** Fast food often causes health problems.  
**Better:** Fast food **tends to** cause health problems **when** it becomes a daily habit.

## Exercise 1: Choose the best sentence (Multiple Choice)
Pick the most appropriate sentence for an academic opinion paragraph.

1)  
A. Cars are always bad for cities.  
B. Cars are bad for cities.  
C. Cars **can** be harmful for cities **when** public transport is limited.  

2)  
A. Online learning ruins education.  
B. Online learning **often** reduces interaction unless courses are designed carefully.  
C. Online learning might maybe perhaps reduce interaction.

3)  
A. Governments will solve traffic immediately by banning cars.  
B. Restricting cars in city centres is **likely to** reduce traffic in high-density areas.  
C. Restricting cars reduces traffic.

**Answer key:** 1C, 2B, 3B

## Exercise 2: Upgrade the claim (Rewrite)
Rewrite each sentence using **one hedge** and **one condition**.

1) Public transport solves traffic.  
2) Social media causes loneliness.  
3) Advertising manipulates consumers.  

### Sample answers
1) Public transport **can reduce** traffic, **especially** in high-density areas.  
2) Social media **can contribute to** loneliness **when** it replaces offline relationships.  
3) Advertising **often influences** consumers, **particularly** through emotional appeals.

## Mini Task (IELTS Task 2 style)
Rewrite this paragraph to sound more academic. Keep the opinion, but reduce absolute language.

**Original (too absolute):**  
Governments should ban all cars in city centres because cars destroy the environment and make people unhealthy. This policy will fix traffic and pollution immediately.

### Model answer (one possible version)
Governments could restrict private cars in city centres because heavy traffic **tends to** worsen air quality and **can** discourage active lifestyles. While a full ban may not be realistic everywhere, targeted restrictions are **likely to** reduce congestion in high-density areas, **especially if** public transport is reliable.

## Quick checklist (use this when editing)
- Did I remove **always / never / everyone / no one**?
- Did I hedge my main claim **once**?
- Did I add a **condition** (if/when/especially)?
- Did I keep my opinion clear and confident?
