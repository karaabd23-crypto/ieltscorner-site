## Would is not just a conditional form

At C1 level, **would** expresses habit, tentativeness, hypotheticality, politeness,
volition, narrative projection, and reported stance. This lesson focuses on meaning
and discourse control, not memorization.

---

## 1. Would for past habit (repeated actions)

Here, **would** marks repeated, characteristic actions in the past.  
It does **not** normally describe states.

### Natural
When I worked in Toronto, I **would take** the Lakeshore train every morning.

### Problematic
When I was younger, I **would know** all my neighbours.  
*Know is a state → use “used to know” or simple past.*

## Exam payoff

Accurate use of **would** signals control of time reference and aspect — a key marker
of high-level writing and speaking in IELTS & CELPIP.

---

## 2. Tentative or softened assertion

In advanced discourse, **would** allows speakers and writers to soften claims,
signal politeness, and manage stance.
